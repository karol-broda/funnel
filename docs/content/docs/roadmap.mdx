## feature breakdown

### âœ… **what works now**

**http tunneling** - the core functionality is complete and stable:
- websocket-based communication between client and server
- http request/response proxying through the tunnel
- subdomain-based routing for tunnel identification

**custom tunnel ids** - flexible tunnel naming:
- use your own memorable subdomain names
- auto-generated ids using domain-safe alphabet
- 3-63 character length with validation

**auto-reconnection** - reliable connection management:
- clients automatically reconnect when connection is lost
- exponential backoff prevents connection storms
- graceful handling of network interruptions

**cross-platform support** - works everywhere:
- builds for linux, macos, windows
- supports both amd64 and arm64 architectures
- single binary distribution

**custom domains** - flexible deployment:
- works with any domain name, not just localhost
- supports production deployments with real domains
- integrates with existing dns infrastructure

### ðŸ”„ **working on next**

**server api** - programmatic server management:
- rest api for tunnel lifecycle management
- monitoring and statistics endpoints
- configuration management via api

**client api** - programmatic client control:
- sdk for embedding client functionality
- configuration management and control
- integration with existing applications

### ðŸ“‹ **planned improvements**

**tunnel statistics** - comprehensive monitoring:
- request counts and bandwidth usage tracking
- connection health and uptime monitoring
- historical data and analytics

**client authentication** - secure access control:
- api key-based authentication for clients
- user management and permissions
- integration with existing auth systems

**https by default** - automatic security:
- automatic tls certificate generation
- secure tunnel endpoints by default
- let's encrypt integration

**oauth integration** - enterprise security:
- secure tunnel access with oauth tokens
- integration with popular oauth providers
- token-based access control

**tcp forwarding** - broader protocol support:
- tunnel any tcp service, not just http
- support for databases, ssh, and other tcp services
- port forwarding capabilities

**multiple tunnels per client** - improved efficiency:
- run multiple services through a single client connection
- shared connection overhead
- simplified client management

**web dashboard** - visual management:
- browser-based tunnel monitoring
- real-time connection status
- graphical configuration interface

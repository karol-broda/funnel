the `funnel` client is the command-line tool you use on your local machine to connect your service to a funnel server.

## `funnel http`

this is the primary command for creating an http tunnel.

```bash
funnel http [address:port | port] [flags]
```

### arguments

-   **`[address:port | port]`** (required): the local address of the service you want to expose.
    -   if you provide just a port (e.g., `3000`), it will default to `localhost:3000`.
    -   you can provide a full address (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8080`).

### flags

| flag      | shorthand | default                  | description                                                              |
| :-------- | :-------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--server`  | `-s`      | `http://localhost:8080`  | the url of the remote funnel server. use `ws://` or `wss://`.             |
| `--id`      | `-i`      | (randomly generated)     | the custom subdomain to request for the tunnel.                          |
| `--help`    | `-h`      |                          | show help for the command.                                               |

### examples

```bash
# expose a service on port 3000, connecting to a local server
funnel http 3000

# expose a service on a different host and port
funnel http 192.168.1.100:8000

# connect to a remote server with a custom subdomain
funnel http 3000 --server wss://my-server.com --id my-app-demo
```

## `funnel version`

prints the version of the funnel client.

```bash
funnel version
```

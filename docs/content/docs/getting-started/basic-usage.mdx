<Callout title="complete example" intent="info">
this guide walks you through creating your first tunnel, from starting a local service to accessing it from anywhere on the internet.
</Callout>

## prerequisites

<Cards>
<Card title="🌐 local service" description="a web service running on your machine (we'll use localhost:3000)" />
<Card title="🔧 funnel client" description="the funnel client binary installed on your machine" />
<Card title="🐳 docker" description="docker installed to run the server" />
</Cards>

<Steps>

### start a local service

first, you need a local web service to expose. if you don't have one, you can start a simple python web server.

<Callout title="test server" intent="tip">
this python server will serve the current directory on port 3000, perfect for testing your tunnel.
</Callout>

```bash
# this will serve the current directory on port 3000
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

you should see output like:
```
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 3000 (http://0.0.0.0:3000/) ...
```

### start the funnel server

next, start the funnel server using docker. this is the remote component that will listen for public traffic.

<Callout title="server component" intent="info">
the server acts as a bridge between public internet traffic and your local client. it runs independently and can serve multiple clients.
</Callout>

```bash
# starts the server on the default port 8080
docker run -d --name funnel-server -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/karol-broda/funnel-server:latest
```

verify the server is running:
```bash
docker logs funnel-server
```

you should see logs indicating the server is listening on port 8080.

### connect the funnel client

now, connect your local service to the server. this command tells the funnel client to connect to your remote server and forward traffic to your local service on port 3000.

<Callout title="custom subdomain" intent="tip">
we're using the custom subdomain `demo` for this example. you can choose any available subdomain name.
</Callout>

```bash
# connect to the server, forwarding to localhost:3000
funnel http 3000 --server http://localhost:8080 --id demo
```

you should see output similar to:
```
✓ Connected to server
✓ Tunnel active: http://demo.localhost:8080
✓ Forwarding to localhost:3000
```

### access your service

<Callout title="success!" intent="success">
your local service is now exposed to the world! you can access it from any device with internet connectivity.
</Callout>

test your tunnel:
```bash
curl http://demo.localhost:8080
```

you should see the response from your local python web server. the request flow is:
1. **curl** → **funnel server** → **websocket** → **funnel client** → **localhost:3000**
2. **localhost:3000** → **funnel client** → **websocket** → **funnel server** → **curl**

</Steps>

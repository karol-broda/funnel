you can get started with funnel by either using a one-line install script for the client, or by building from source for both the client and server.

## client installation

### one-line install (linux/macos)

the easiest way to install the `funnel` client is with the following script. it will detect your os and architecture, and install the correct binary to `/usr/local/bin`.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karol-broda/funnel/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

### building from source

if you prefer to build from source, you'll need to have [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed.

```bash
# 1. clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/karol-broda/funnel.git
cd funnel

# 2. build the client
make build-client

# 3. (optional) install it to your path
sudo mv ./bin/funnel /usr/local/bin/funnel
```

## server installation

the server must be built from source.

<Callout title="prerequisites">
  you'll need [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on the machine that will run the server.
</Callout>

```bash
# 1. clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/karol-broda/funnel.git
cd funnel

# 2. build the server
make build-server

# 3. the binary will be at ./bin/funnel-server
./bin/funnel-server --version
```

once you have the server binary, you can run it directly. see the [server cli reference](/docs/reference/server-cli) for configuration options.

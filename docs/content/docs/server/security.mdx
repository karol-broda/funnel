<Callout title="security model" intent="warning">
funnel currently uses a simple security model: **anyone who knows your server address can connect and create tunnels**. this is suitable for development environments but requires additional protection for production use.
</Callout>

## current security features

<Cards>
<Card title="🔐 tls encryption" description="automatic https certificates via let's encrypt" />
<Card title="🆔 tunnel id validation" description="basic format validation and uniqueness checking" />
<Card title="📋 comprehensive logging" description="detailed logging for monitoring connections" />
<Card title="🔒 modern tls" description="secure tls configuration with modern ciphers" />
</Cards>

## what's not included

<Callout title="no built-in access control" intent="warning">
the server does not have built-in authentication, authorization, or user management. protection must be implemented at the network or proxy level.
</Callout>

current limitations:
- **no authentication** - no user accounts, tokens, or passwords
- **no authorization** - anyone can connect if they know the server address
- **no rate limiting** - no built-in protection against abuse
- **no ip restrictions** - accepts connections from any ip address

## tls encryption

<Callout title="https is supported" intent="info">
the server has built-in support for automatic tls certificate generation using let's encrypt.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Automatic TLS', 'Manual Certificates', 'Certificate Management']}>
<Tab value="Automatic TLS">
enable automatic tls with let's encrypt:

```bash
docker run -d --name funnel-server \
  -p 80:8080 \
  -p 443:8443 \
  -v $(pwd)/dns-providers.json:/etc/funnel/dns-providers.json \
  -v funnel-certs:/var/lib/funnel/certs \
  -e FUNNEL_ENABLE_TLS=true \
  -e FUNNEL_LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com \
  -e FUNNEL_DNS_PROVIDERS_CONFIG=/etc/funnel/dns-providers.json \
  ghcr.io/karol-broda/funnel-server:latest
```

requires dns provider configuration for certificate validation.
</Tab>

<Tab value="Manual Certificates">
use your own certificates:

```bash
docker run -d --name funnel-server \
  -p 443:8443 \
  -v /path/to/certs:/var/lib/funnel/certs \
  -e FUNNEL_ENABLE_TLS=true \
  ghcr.io/karol-broda/funnel-server:latest
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Certificate Management">
automatic certificate features:
- **on-demand generation** - certificates created on first request
- **automatic renewal** - renewed before expiration
- **wildcard support** - can generate `*.domain.com` certificates
- **secure storage** - stored in docker volume
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## deployment security

since the server lacks built-in access control, secure deployment requires external protection:

<Steps>
<Step>
### network-level protection

use firewall rules to restrict access:

```bash
# allow public access to tunnel traffic
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

# restrict websocket connections to trusted networks
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8080
sudo ufw deny 8080/tcp

sudo ufw enable
```

<Callout title="firewall strategy" intent="tip">
allow public access to ports 80/443 for tunnel traffic, but restrict the websocket port (8080) to trusted networks only.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### reverse proxy with authentication

use nginx or similar to add authentication:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name tunnel.yourdomain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    # require basic auth for websocket connections
    location ~ ^/\?id= {
        auth_basic "Tunnel Access";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
        
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
    
    # public access to tunnels
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

<Callout title="basic auth" intent="tip">
this adds basic authentication to websocket connections while keeping tunnel traffic public.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### vpn or private network

deploy the server in a private network:
- use a vpn to access the server
- deploy on a private subnet
- use ssh tunneling for connections

<Callout title="private deployment" intent="info">
the most secure approach is to deploy in a private network and use vpn/ssh for access.
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## monitoring

<Callout title="built-in logging" intent="info">
the server provides comprehensive logging for monitoring connections and tunnel activity.
</Callout>

monitor these events:

<Tabs items={['Connection Events', 'Certificate Events', 'Error Events']}>
<Tab value="Connection Events">
```bash
# view real-time connection logs
docker logs -f funnel-server

# search for specific events
docker logs funnel-server | grep -i "websocket\|tunnel"
```

key events to monitor:
- websocket connection attempts
- tunnel creation and removal
- failed connection attempts
</Tab>

<Tab value="Certificate Events">
```bash
# monitor certificate activities
docker logs funnel-server | grep -i "certificate\|tls\|acme"
```

certificate-related events:
- certificate generation
- renewal activities
- tls handshake errors
</Tab>

<Tab value="Error Events">
```bash
# monitor errors and failures
docker logs funnel-server | grep -i "error\|failed\|rejected"
```

important errors:
- connection failures
- invalid tunnel ids
- certificate issues
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## future security features

<Callout title="roadmap" intent="info">
we plan to add built-in authentication and authorization features in future releases.
</Callout>

planned features:
- **authentication tokens** - api keys for client connections
- **user management** - user accounts and permissions
- **rate limiting** - protection against abuse
- **ip allowlists** - built-in ip-based access control

## security updates

<Callout title="stay updated" intent="warning">
regularly update to get the latest security patches and features.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### check for updates

monitor [github releases](https://github.com/karol-broda/funnel/releases) for new versions.
</Step>

<Step>
### update procedure

```bash
# pull latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/karol-broda/funnel-server:latest

# restart with new image
docker stop funnel-server
docker rm funnel-server
docker run -d --name funnel-server [your-config] ghcr.io/karol-broda/funnel-server:latest
```

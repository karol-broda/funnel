# server security

Securing your funnel server is crucial to protect your services and data. This guide covers the essential security practices for your deployment.

## tls encryption

All traffic to the funnel server should be encrypted using TLS. The server has built-in support for automatic TLS certificate generation from Let's Encrypt.

### enabling tls

To enable automatic TLS, you need to:
1.  **Provide a domain name**: Set the `FUNNEL_DOMAIN` environment variable.
2.  **Configure a DNS provider**: Set the `FUNNEL_DNS_PROVIDER` and `FUNNEL_DNS_PROVIDER_CONFIG_FILE` environment variables.

The server will then automatically obtain and renew TLS certificates for your domain. For more details on the DNS provider configuration, see the [Deployment](/docs/server/deployment) guide.

### certificate management

- **On-Demand Generation**: Certificates are generated automatically on the first request for a new domain.
- **Wildcard Support**: The server can generate wildcard certificates (e.g., `*.your-domain.com`).
- **Automatic Renewal**: Certificates are renewed automatically before they expire.

## restricting access

By default, anyone who knows your server's address can connect a client and expose services. You can restrict access in a few ways:

### 1. firewall rules

Use a firewall to restrict which IP addresses can connect to the server's control port (the port used by the funnel client). This is the most straightforward way to limit access.

### 2. authentication tokens (coming soon)

We are working on adding support for authentication tokens to allow only authorized clients to connect. This feature will be available in a future release.

## secure by default

The funnel server is designed with security in mind:

- **Secure TLS Ciphers**: The server uses a modern and secure set of TLS cipher suites.
- **No Unencrypted Traffic**: When TLS is enabled, the server will not accept unencrypted traffic on the TLS port.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: The Docker container runs as a non-root user.

## security updates

It is important to keep your funnel server up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches. We announce new releases on our GitHub page.
